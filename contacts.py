# contacts.py
#
# This script:
#   1) Identifies protofilaments based on CA-CA stacking.
#   2) Finds the "middle chain" (chain_offset == 0) in each protofilament.
#   3) For residues in the middle chains, finds contacts between:
#        - side-chain atoms (non-backbone, non-hydrogen), and
#        - CA atoms of GLY residues,
#      within sidechain_cutoff.
#   4) Applies an "outer side" filter per residue and per contact segment:
#        - For each residue i in a protofilament, a local plane is defined
#          using:
#              N(i) in a reference chain of that protofilament,
#              N(i) in a neighboring amyloid layer,
#              C(i) in the same reference chain.
#        - For each protofilament, every chain picks a single neighbor chain:
#              the chain in the same protofilament with the smallest
#              absolute difference in chain_offset (not equal to itself).
#        - The plane normal is stored together with N(i) as a reference
#          point for that residue.
#        - The sidechain "direction" is approximated by the position of
#          CB(i).
#        - A contact segment between two atoms is kept only if both
#          endpoints lie on the same side of this plane as CB(i), for
#          each residue where this plane can be defined; otherwise it is
#          discarded.
#        - If the plane or CB is missing, that residue does not veto the
#          contact (the contact is not discarded on that basis).
#   5) Excludes local sequence neighbors along the protofilament axis:
#        - For each protofilament, each chain gets a "sequence index"
#          per residue in PDB order. The first residue of the chain gets
#          index 0. For each subsequent residue:
#              * Let delta_resnum be the absolute difference in residue
#                numbers between this residue and the previous one.
#              * If delta_resnum == 1, the sequence index increases by 1.
#              * If delta_resnum != 1, and both residues have CA atoms
#                and their CA-CA distance is < max_backbone_gap_distance,
#                the sequence index also increases by 1 (non-consecutive
#                numbering is tolerated because the backbone is continuous).
#              * Otherwise the sequence index increases by delta_resnum.
#        - For each chain, an integer axial offset is computed relative
#          to the middle chain in that protofilament using overlapping
#          residue numbers and these sequence indices.
#        - The axial index of a residue is:
#              axial_index = sequence_index_in_chain + chain_axial_offset
#        - Intra-protofilament contacts (same pf) are excluded when the
#          absolute difference between these axial indices is less than
#          min_sequence_separation.
#   6) For each residue pair, stores:
#        - shortest atom-atom distance among considered atoms (distance)
#        - coordinates of the closest atom pair.
#        - contact is stored only once per unordered residue pair when
#          both residues correspond to middle-chain residues in their
#          protofilaments, using an ordering on (pf, residue_number).
#        - multi-layer contacts (different chain offsets for residue2)
#          are collapsed to the shortest distance.
#   7) For each residue in the middle chain of a protofilament, computes
#      a handedness value based on the left/right position of the side
#      chain in a CA-based local frame.
#   8) Computes a helical rise per protofilament from the average CA-CA
#      Z-distance between identical residues in layers 0 and 1.
#   9) For each stored contact, computes a real-valued ca_offset for
#      residue2 as a fractional number of rises based on the vertical
#      (Z) separation between the middle-layer copies of residue2 and
#      residue1:
#
#          ca_offset = (z_mid_partner(residue2) - z_mid_src(residue1)) / rise
#
#      where z_mid_src(residue1) is the CA z-coordinate of residue1 in
#      the middle chain of its protofilament, and z_mid_partner(residue2)
#      is the CA z-coordinate of residue2 in the middle chain of its
#      protofilament. The rise used is the average of the available
#      per-protofilament rises for the two protofilaments involved in
#      the contact (or the single available rise if only one is defined).
